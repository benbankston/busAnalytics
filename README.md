# Business Analytics Final Project

I worked with a group to report on summary statistics from a dataset of Yelp reviews (https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/). We analyzed average business ratings and prices by industry, location, and company to better understand how and why consumers leave Yelp reviews.

Our 13 data visualizations were created using Exploratory.
